# Digirule-2U-Coder
When the original Digirule 2 came out it was accompanied by a coder created in Excel which allowed
you to write code and have it and the instructions automatically changed into binary in the order it
would be entered into the Ruler.
The new Digirule 2U does not have this so I have created a coder "Digirule-2U-Coder" built on the design
of the original one but modified to reflect all of the instructions. In addition the User Manual section 
on the meaning of all the instructions along with examples has been copied and presented as a drop down 
comment field which enabled by hovering the mouse over the Instruction.

All of the cells,columns and rows with the exception of the "Instructions Column" and the area set aside to name the file 
have been locked to prevent the formula,labels,tables etc from being overwritten. The columns making up the tables for the Look Up 
function has also been hidden, no password has been set for the unlocking or unhiding function in order to 
enable anyone to change the programming as they see fit.
The BLANK form can be copied to one of the spare sheets and used for programming. See below example of an 8
bit adder.

Thanks to Bradley for creating the original coder from which this one was developed from and the User Manual details which
were copied into the instruction Fields.
