# Digirule-2U-Coder
When the origional Digirule 2 came out it was accompanied with a coder created in Excel which allowed
you to write code and have it and the instructions automatically changed into binary in the order it
would be entered into the Ruler.
The new Digirule 2U does not have this so I have created a coder "Digirule-2U-Coder" built on the design
of the origional one but modified to reflect all of the instructions. In addition the User manual section 
on the meaning of all the instructions along with examples has been copied and presented as a drop down 
comment field which enabled by hovering the mouse over the Instruction.
